# docker-qemu-rpi1
Emulates a Raspberry Pi

## Requirements
- Prepare a folder for the container
- Put os.qcow2 into the folder
- Use ```MOUNT="folder" bash run.sh```

## Usage
Does not take any parameters ATM

## Ports
5901 for VNC

## Security
The server only accepts VNC connection from localhost, meaning you have to do SSH-tunnelling.

## VNC over SSH
Server: do nothing

Client:

```
ssh root@blah -L 5901:localhost:localport
```

## Ongoing features
- Properly working internet
- CPU limit
- ssh-copy-id so no more having to enter password everytime you connect to it
